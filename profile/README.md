As the number of devices connected to the internet continues to grow, so does the potential for malicious actors to launch large-scale attacks. Among them, Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks have become increasingly common in recent years. 
By leveraging machine learning and deep learning algorithms, network administrators can quickly identify and respond to potential threats before they become a problem.
So, We have made this project as a part of our thesis to analyze network traffic and detect suspicious patterns that may indicate a DDoS attack through log file analysis. We are primarily docusing on identifying 10 different variations of DDoS attack.
